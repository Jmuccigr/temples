Apart from the continual work done by the project's director, John D. Muccigrosso, several sets of students have contributed over the years:

1. Preliminary work on the project was done by the Spring 2016 "Archaeology of Greece and Rome" students at [Drew University](https://www.drew.edu/):

- Meredith Patterson
- Alexis Ruark
- Amanda Stone
- Zach Zupa

2. As part of Drew's [Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org)-funded [Digital Humanities Summer Institute](http://www.drew.edu/digital-humanities/about-us/summer-institute/), Alexis Ruark created what is the original version of the database as her project, leading to the first commits to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Jmuccigr/temples/) by the end of the summer.

3. Spring 2021 "Archaeology of Greece and Rome" student Spencer Hall added a number of Doric temples as part of his final project for the class.[^Hall]
