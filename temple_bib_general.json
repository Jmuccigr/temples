  {"id":"Barletta1990","abstract":"Of the regional styles in Archaic Doric architecture, that identified in the Achaian colonies of South Italy has received particular attention. One of its distinctive elements, a capital with leaf necking, recalls Mycenaean decoration. This evidence, along with the presence of several characteristics of the style (including the capital with leaf necking, the prostyle plan, and the half-column) in the Peloponnesos, has led to the suggestion of origins in early Peloponnesian architecture. A more complete examination of the geographical distribution and chronology of the various elements of this style, however, demonstrates its adoption over a widespread area surrounding the Ionian Sea and its appearance in the Northwest and West earlier than in the Peloponnesos.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Barletta","given":"Barbara A."}],"container-title":"American Journal of Archaeology","container-title-short":"AJA","DOI":"10.2307/505525","ISSN":"0002-9114","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1990]]},"language":"en","page":"45-72","publisher":"Archaeological Institute of America","source":"JSTOR","title":"An \"Ionian Sea\" Style in Archaic Doric Architecture","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/505525","volume":"94"},

  {"id":"Castagnoli1984","abstract":"1. An analysis of the meaning of the terms aedes, templum, delubrum,fanum, sacrarium, lucus: even if these terms are often interchangeable, the precise meaning of each can be established. 2. On the basis of the original meaning of templum (a ritually delimited space), it is proposed to apply this term to the platform with the aedes of Fortuna and of Mater Matuta, the 'area sacra di S. Omobono', and also to the 'podium' of the temple of the Capitoline triad. A typological comparison may also be made between these two templa, which were perhaps constructed at almost the same time. 3. The typology of the temple inside an area bounded by a portico may also be referred to the templum. The numerous variants of this typology are examined. 4. After a consideration of templum in its more specific sense of locus augurii aut auspicii causa definitus, the two auguracula—on the arx and the collis Latiaris—are examined in particular, and new identifications are proposed for them. 5. The term lucus raises the question of extra-urban cult sites. A scheme of classification is proposed: shrines of purely local importance, and sanctuaries repeating city cults in more distant sites (political motivation may be detected). For cult sites very close to the city the problem is more complex, involving in part the pomerium, evocatio, and the introduction of foreign cults.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Castagnoli","given":"Ferdinando"}],"container-title":"Papers of the British School at Rome","container-title-short":"PBSR","ISSN":"0068-2462","issued":{"date-parts":[[1984]]},"language":"it","note":"00021","page":"3-20","source":"JSTOR","title":"Il Tempio Romano: Questioni di Terminologia e di Tipologia","title-short":"Il Tempio Romano","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/40310802","volume":"52"},

  {"id":"MazarakisAinian2016","abstract":"The development of the Greek temple into the form it finally acquired in the Classical period followed a long diversified trajectory. Sanctuaries outside settlements were no longer controlled by some kind of central authority as in the Late Bronze Age. These changes may have marked the origin of the Panhellenic sanctuaries. Occasionally, earlier rulers’ dwellings, such as the LH IIIC Megaron T at Tiryns, were converted into temples. The focus of cult in Greek sanctuaries, since the beginning of the Iron Age, was the altar. The cult at the Artemision of Ephesos dates back to the Protogeometric period, but the earliest cult building dates to the mid‐seventh century BCE. Temple architecture is characterized, among others, by monumentality, and the adoption of the peristyle by several temples. The Temple of Apollo at Corinth and the temples with a peristyle at Isthmia, Argos, Thermon, Samos, and Ephesos are typical of this architectural bloom.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Mazarakis Ainian","given":"Alexander"}],"container-title":"A Companion to Greek Architecture","DOI":"10.1002/9781118327586.ch2","editor":[{"family":"Miles","given":"Margaret M."}],"event-place":"Hoboken, NJ, USA","ISBN":"978-1-118-32758-6 978-1-4443-3599-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,7,18]]},"language":"en","page":"15-30","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","publisher-place":"Hoboken, NJ, USA","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Early Greek Temples","type":"chapter","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/9781118327586.ch2"},
