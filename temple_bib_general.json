  {"id":"Barletta1990","abstract":"Of the regional styles in Archaic Doric architecture, that identified in the Achaian colonies of South Italy has received particular attention. One of its distinctive elements, a capital with leaf necking, recalls Mycenaean decoration. This evidence, along with the presence of several characteristics of the style (including the capital with leaf necking, the prostyle plan, and the half-column) in the Peloponnesos, has led to the suggestion of origins in early Peloponnesian architecture. A more complete examination of the geographical distribution and chronology of the various elements of this style, however, demonstrates its adoption over a widespread area surrounding the Ionian Sea and its appearance in the Northwest and West earlier than in the Peloponnesos.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Barletta","given":"Barbara A."}],"citation-key":"Barletta1990","container-title":"American Journal of Archaeology","container-title-short":"AJA","DOI":"10.2307/505525","ISSN":"0002-9114","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1990"]]},"language":"en","page":"45-72","publisher":"Archaeological Institute of America","source":"JSTOR","title":"An \"Ionian Sea\" style in archaic Doric architecture","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/505525","volume":"94"},

  {"id":"Castagnoli1984","abstract":"1. An analysis of the meaning of the terms aedes, templum, delubrum,fanum, sacrarium, lucus: even if these terms are often interchangeable, the precise meaning of each can be established. 2. On the basis of the original meaning of templum (a ritually delimited space), it is proposed to apply this term to the platform with the aedes of Fortuna and of Mater Matuta, the 'area sacra di S. Omobono', and also to the 'podium' of the temple of the Capitoline triad. A typological comparison may also be made between these two templa, which were perhaps constructed at almost the same time. 3. The typology of the temple inside an area bounded by a portico may also be referred to the templum. The numerous variants of this typology are examined. 4. After a consideration of templum in its more specific sense of locus augurii aut auspicii causa definitus, the two auguracula—on the arx and the collis Latiaris—are examined in particular, and new identifications are proposed for them. 5. The term lucus raises the question of extra-urban cult sites. A scheme of classification is proposed: shrines of purely local importance, and sanctuaries repeating city cults in more distant sites (political motivation may be detected). For cult sites very close to the city the problem is more complex, involving in part the pomerium, evocatio, and the introduction of foreign cults.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",10,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Castagnoli","given":"Ferdinando"}],"citation-key":"Castagnoli1984","container-title":"Papers of the British School at Rome","container-title-short":"PBSR","ISSN":"0068-2462","issued":{"date-parts":[["1984"]]},"language":"it-IT","note":"00021","page":"3-20","source":"JSTOR","title":"Il tempio romano: questioni di terminologia e di tipologia","title-short":"Il tempio romano","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/40310802","volume":"52"},

  {"id":"Edlund-Berry2008","abstract":"One detail of the so-called Tuscan temple is the Etruscan round moulding, known from Etruria and monuments in Rome. The earliest preserved example (sixth century B.C.E.) comes from S. Omobono in Rome, followed by Satricum, Pyrgi, Ardea, and Tarquinia through the fourth century B.C.E. As Rome expanded its political interests in the third century B.C.E., newly founded colonies were equipped with major temples (Capitolia) that had a Tuscan plan and often Etruscan round mouldings (Sora, Isernia). Beginning in the second century B.C.E., new construction or remodeling of temples often displayed parallel traditions, including a Roman cyma reversa (Paestum) or an Etruscan round podium moulding (Cosa). The presence of the Etruscan round mouldings is not arbitrary. Only when Rome establishes its own architectural language through the cyma reversa moulding do we see that it has shed its dependence on the past and reached its own goals, political as well as architectural.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Edlund-Berry","given":"Ingrid"}],"citation-key":"Edlund-Berry2008","container-title":"American Journal of Archaeology","container-title-short":"AJA","DOI":"10.3764/aja.112.3.441","ISSN":"0002-9114","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"language":"en","page":"441-447","publisher":"Archaeological Institute of America","source":"JSTOR","title":"The language of Etrusco-Italic architecture: new perspectives on Tuscan temples","title-short":"The language of etrusco-italic architecture","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/20627482","volume":"112"},

  {"id":"Maschek2014","abstract":"Traditionally, scientific interest in architectural decoration has been focused on questions of chronology and typology. The focus was primarily directed towards certain type fossils for dating purposes. This way of research proved to be highly prolific in its own regard. However, central questions concerning the cultural aspects of Late Republican Roman and Italic architectural design have not yet been approached convincingly. For that reason, the main intention of the present paper is to show some aspects of the diachronic evolution of temple design and decoration in central Italy and its dependence on superimposed cultural-historical and socio-economic processes. In archaeological scholarship a paradigm of ‘Hellenisation’ has been established to explain cultural merging processes in the regions of central Italy from about 200 BC to the early Imperial period. In this model, the diffusion of various forms and styles of decoration was often ascribed to the activity of mobile Greek workshops or the aesthetic preferences of certain social classes. However, typological analysis and diachronic mapping of monuments leads to a thoroughly different picture: first, the application and use of certain motifs need to be distinguished in terms of both chronological and spatial parameters. Second, particular decorative patterns and styles obviously were related to the function of the respective monuments whose material qualities and long-time visibility should always be taken into account. Third, motivic dependencies and specific features of regional production must be isolated and examined with special regard to their historical reciprocity.","author":[{"family":"Maschek","given":"Dominik"}],"citation-key":"Maschek2014","collection-number":"12","collection-title":"Studien zur antiken Stadt","container-title":"Antike Bauornamentik: Grenzen und Möglichkeiten ihrer Erforschung","editor":[{"family":"Lipps","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Maschek","given":"Dominik"}],"event-place":"Wiesbaden","ISBN":"978-3-89500-997-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"de-DE","page":"181-202","publisher":"Dr. Ludwig Reichert Verlag","publisher-place":"Wiesbaden","source":"BnF ISBN","title":"Der Tempel neue Kleider?

  {"id":"MazarakisAinian2016","abstract":"The development of the Greek temple into the form it finally acquired in the Classical period followed a long diversified trajectory. Sanctuaries outside settlements were no longer controlled by some kind of central authority as in the Late Bronze Age. These changes may have marked the origin of the Panhellenic sanctuaries. Occasionally, earlier rulers’ dwellings, such as the LH IIIC Megaron T at Tiryns, were converted into temples. The focus of cult in Greek sanctuaries, since the beginning of the Iron Age, was the altar. The cult at the Artemision of Ephesos dates back to the Protogeometric period, but the earliest cult building dates to the mid‐seventh century BCE. Temple architecture is characterized, among others, by monumentality, and the adoption of the peristyle by several temples. The Temple of Apollo at Corinth and the temples with a peristyle at Isthmia, Argos, Thermon, Samos, and Ephesos are typical of this architectural bloom.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Mazarakis Ainian","given":"Alexander"}],"citation-key":"MazarakisAinian2016","container-title":"A companion to Greek architecture","DOI":"10.1002/9781118327586.ch2","editor":[{"family":"Miles","given":"Margaret M."}],"event-place":"Hoboken, NJ, USA","ISBN":"978-1-118-32758-6 978-1-4443-3599-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",7,18]]},"language":"en-US","page":"15-30","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","publisher-place":"Hoboken, NJ, USA","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Early Greek temples","type":"chapter","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/9781118327586.ch2"},

More specifically, the recording of the temples and their characteristics was carried out through extensive bibliographic research and then their lo-cation was determined with the help of a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment. Google Earth Pro® images were used to calculate their specific setting characteristics, especially their orientation and area. In addition, their altitude, their distance from the coastline, their distance from paved roads and their distance from paved or non-paved roads were calculated. Moreover, by correlating all the data, an attempt was made to draw conclusions.
